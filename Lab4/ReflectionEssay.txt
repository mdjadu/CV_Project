Reflection Essay

1. Piecewise Affine transformation

Question: How to select the grid-point correspondences for this problem?
Answer: Given that the X axis /horizontal /column was divided in 20 parts.
        We can use that and for Y axis we can divide it by any number.
        We have used 20 only (we can use 10 15 too).
        Using this we can create a grid and use them.

Question: Explain the process that you followed, even if it is elementary.
Answer: Step 1 - created the grid (how? answer above).
        Step 2 - By observation (1.5 cycle) we found the cycle was 3pis.
        Step 3 - By observation we found the Amplitude.
        Got the image :-)
